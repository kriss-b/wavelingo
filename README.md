## What is Wavelingo?

[Wavelingo](https://wavelingo.app/) connects to [KiwiSDR](http://kiwisdr.com/) receivers around the world, streams their audio in real time, transcribes spoken content, and translates it into your chosen language — all from a single web interface (dektop, tablet or smartphone).

## ✨ Features

- **🗺️ Interactive World Map** — Browse and select KiwiSDR receivers worldwide (new added regularly)
- **📻 Live Radio Streaming** — Connect to any KiwiSDR (if it is available) and listen to shortwave frequencies (0–30 MHz) with LSB/USB modulation
- **🎙️ Real-time Transcription** — Automatic speech-to-text
- **🌍 Live Translation** — Transcribed text is translated on-the-fly into 9 languages
- **📱 Responsive Design** — Tabbed mobile layout and split-panel desktop layout

## 🚀 User Guide

### Quick Start

1. **Select a receiver** — Click a marker on the map to pick a KiwiSDR station
2. **Set the frequency** — Enter a frequency in kHz. Modulation is auto-selected (LSB below 10 MHz, USB above)
3. **Connect** — Click **Connect** to start streaming audio from the receiver
4. **Translate** — Click **Translate** to begin real-time transcription and translation
5. **Choose your language** — Use the language selector to pick your target translation language

### Tips

- If a server is busy or down, try another one — status messages will guide you
- The audio level meter shows signal activity in real time
- Translations appear as subtitle-style text below the original transcription. You can change the target language at any time and all translations will be updated.
- Bold green text in translations highlights named entities (call signs, location, ...)

### Beta Limitations

- Transcription sessions are limited in time
- Join the [Telegram group](https://t.me/+l5Y_cyYFsXBhODBk) for updates and support
